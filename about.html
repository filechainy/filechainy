               Our objective is create a decentralized storage system with a fair reward mechanism.<br><br>

               The basic system model is that each server must be capable to check if the others servers hosting the same files. Each node also can compare if the registers of the files the same in the others nodes  (that is, a database only with URLs)<br><br> 

               The design principle aim is that even the lowest device in computational power should be able to run a node.<br><br>

               For this be possible a node must not perform all tasks and not many. But there must be different types of nodes, for example, some that just send files, others that host or validate.<br><br>

               One aspect that can make nodes faster and simpler is by default saving and sending files in chunks. So there's no rework to split or assemble a file every time it's uploaded.<br><br>
              
               Lightweight nodes can send and download files via http GET request.
               
             <br><br>
             <h1>Decentralized network</h1><br>

               A decentralized network must take into account:<br><br>
               1) The ease with which a node can participate in the network or download all of its content<br><br>
               2) Save pieces of the same file on different servers

             <br><br>
             <h1>Terms of use</h1><br>

               3. Your initial balance starts at zero. But, you earn according to the growth of the network or your performance in file hosting<br><br>
