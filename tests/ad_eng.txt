Decentralized networks have several advantages over centralized networks:

They are more resilient to attacks, because there is no single point of failure that an attacker can target. This makes them more secure and less prone to downtime.

They are more democratic, because they are not controlled by a single entity. This means that everyone has an equal say in how the network is run and decisions are made.

They are more private, because the data is distributed across many different nodes and is not stored in a central location. This makes it harder for third parties to access or monitor the data.

They are more scalable, because they can handle more users and transactions without experiencing performance issues.

They are often more efficient, because they do not rely on a central authority to process transactions or make decisions. This can make them faster and more cost-effective.
