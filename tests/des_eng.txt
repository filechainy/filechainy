A decentralized network is a type of network where there is no central authority or central point of control. Instead, the network relies on a distributed system of nodes to manage and coordinate the network. This means that each node in the network has equal power and authority, and no single node can dominate the network or make decisions on its own. Decentralized networks are often used to create distributed systems and applications, such as blockchain and peer-to-peer networks, where security, resilience, and trust are important considerations.
